"""dreamOfkiki axiom bridge — wires the DR-0..DR-4 formal layer to nerve_wml.

Upstream gate lifted 2026-04-21 : dream-of-kiki C-v0.8.0+PARTIAL published
the ``kiki_oniric.axioms`` public API (DR-0..DR-4 as frozen ``Axiom``
instances). The factories below are now live and build a concrete
:class:`DreamOfKikiNerve` — a ``SimNerve`` that carries its originating
axiom spec so the round-trip dual ``to_dream_of_kiki`` is exact.

Wiring per ``docs/integration-dream-of-kiki.md`` :

- DR-0 (replay) → ``SimNerve`` event buffer (default ``n_wmls = |modalities|``)
- DR-1 (downscale) → per-edge :class:`Transducer` entropy regulariser
- DR-2 (restructure) → :func:`bridge.transducer_resize.resize_transducer`
  (not wired at construction ; invoked by downstream consolidation)
- DR-3 (recombine) → :class:`Transducer` gating mode read from spec
- DR-4 (bit-exact R1) → ``SimNerve(seed=...)`` + per-transducer deterministic init

The bridge remains permissive about spec value types : values may be
``kiki_oniric.axioms.Axiom`` instances, plain dicts, or anything else.
The factory only reads optional hints (e.g. ``DR-3 → "gating"``,
``DR-4 → "seed"``) ; missing hints fall back to deterministic defaults.

See ``docs/integration-dream-of-kiki.md`` for the mapping table.
