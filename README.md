**Substrate-agnostic nerve protocol for inter-module communication in hybrid neural systems.**

Citation : each release is archived on Zenodo (concept DOI [10.5281/zenodo.19656342](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19656342) resolves to the latest version) and linked to the parent programme's OSF pre-registration ([10.17605/OSF.IO/Q6JYN](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/Q6JYN)).

Research engine that validates a discrete-code communication layer between heterogeneous neural modules (World Model Languages, or WMLs). Modules exchange **neuroletters** over a sparse learned topology, multiplexed on gamma/theta rhythms, and converted between local codebooks by per-edge transducers. The paper draft is at [`papers/paper1/main.tex`](papers/paper1/main.tex); the full spec is at [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-18-nerve-wml-design.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-18-nerve-wml-design.md).

## Status — v1.5.2 (2026-04-21, on PyPI)

Installable via `pip install nerve-wml`. Three feature releases landed on
2026-04-21 (v1.4.0 → v1.5.1) on top of the v1.2.3 scientific baseline; see
[§ Post-v1.2.3 API additions](#post-v123-api-additions-2026-04-21) below
or [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for the per-version diff. The **scientific
claims below are the v1.2.3 baseline and remain load-bearing** — the newer
releases added opt-in knobs (plasticity schedule, Gumbel-softmax gating,
spectrogram encoder, dreamOfkiki axiom bridge scaffold) without changing
any headline measurement.

The project is empirically defensible across three experimental axes: real
data, architecture scale, and temporal streaming. Two claims are quantified:

**Claim A — Substrate-agnostic polymorphism (task competence converges).**
Three structurally distinct substrates (stateless MLP, spiking LIF with surrogate-gradient, attention-based Transformer) reach comparable accuracies via the shared Nerve Protocol.

**Claim B — Substrate-agnostic information transmission (codes align).**
Independent substrates share 91–96 % of their emitted code information; a frozen LIF can recover a trained MLP's task competence via a learned linear transducer.

### Headline measurements

| Axis | Finding | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| **Pool scaling law** (MLP ↔ LIF, HardFlow) | $N=2 \to 10.71\%$, $N=16 \to 6.71\%$, $N=32 \to 2.39\%$, $N=64 \to 2.73\%$ plateau. 5 % contract holds distributionally at $N \geq 32$. | `figures/w2_hard_scaling.pdf` |
| **Triple-substrate pool** (MLP + LIF + TRF) | $N=15 \to 8.16\%$, $N=30 \to 5.86\%$, $N=60 \to 4.33\%$ | v1.1.4 |
| **Mutual information** (codes MLP ↔ LIF) | $\mathrm{MI}/H = 0.91$ at $N=1$ (5 seeds), **0.96** at $N=16$ pool (192 cross-pairs) | `figures/info_transmission.pdf` |
| **Round-trip fidelity** (MLP → LIF → MLP) | **0.99** mean (3 seeds) | v0.8 |
| **Cross-substrate merge** (LIF fed by MLP codes only) | **0.97** mean (3 seeds) | v0.8 |
| **MNIST real data** | MLP 0.942, LIF 0.941, gap **1.03 %**, MI/H **0.882** | `figures/mnist_scaling.pdf` |
| **MoonsTask** (2nd distribution) | MI/H = **0.74** (3 seeds) | v1.1.4 |
| **Architecture scale** ($d_\text{hidden}=128$) | Gap AMPLIFIES to 26 % on XOR (arch vs pool scale are orthogonal); Claim B survives | `figures/bigger_arch_scaling.pdf` |
| **Temporal streaming** (16-token sequence) | MI/H = **0.72** at trained step, **0.71** at filler step — structural alignment | `figures/temporal_info_tx.pdf` |
| **Platonic RH alignment** (Huh 2024, pre-VQ mutual-kNN) | MLP ↔ LIF = **0.174** at k=10 (18.8× random, 3 seeds); stable across k∈[5,50] | `figures/platonic_rh_alignment.json` |
| **Direction stability** (LIF ≥ MLP on hard task) | **15/15** pairwise seeds + 5/5 triple-substrate | — |

LIF's spike dynamics give it a substrate-intrinsic $\sim 2$–$3\%$ expressivity edge on XOR-style boundaries (plateau floor). Pool averaging compresses this, architecture width amplifies it.

### Seven concrete findings

1. **The original 12.1 % gap was a decoder asymmetry bug, not a substrate limit.** LIF had a fixed cosine decoder, MLP had a learned head; symmetrizing flipped the sign (LIF now leads).
2. **Single-seed measurements lie.** Multi-seed revealed the N=16 median is 6.7 %, not the lucky 1.68 %.
3. **Scaling law is real and monotonic.** Four-point decay $10.7\% \to 6.7\% \to 2.4\% \to 2.7\%$ plateau.
4. **Claim B is empirical, not architectural.** MI 0.91–0.96, round-trip 0.99, cross-merge 0.97.
5. **Substrate-direction is stable in 15/15 seeds.** LIF's spike edge is a real property, not noise.
6. **Architecture scale and pool scale are orthogonal.** Pool compresses the gap; arch width amplifies it.
7. **Code alignment is structural, not task-gated.** MI at filler timesteps $\approx$ MI at trained timesteps (0.71 vs 0.72).

### Methodological findings (v1.2.1–v1.2.3)

- **MI/H vs CKA on the same argmax codes** (v1.2.1). Mean 0.953 (MI/H) vs 0.910 (CKA argmax one-hot) over 3 seeds. The 4.3 pp gap tracks soft many-to-one code mappings that kernel-alignment metrics miss. MI/H is not CKA renamed — it is the discrete-protocol cousin with measurably different semantics. See `scripts/measure_cka_vs_mi.py` and `docs/positioning.md`.
- **Related Work verified** (v1.2.2). Paper §Related Work cites Kornblith 2019 CKA, Morcos 2018 PWCCA, Moschella 2022 relative representations (ICLR 2023), Saxe 2024 universality, and Hinton 2015 KD — all verified via WebFetch, provenance table in `docs/positioning.md`.
- **KD match-compute ablation honest verdict** (v1.2.3). At matched compute on HardFlowProxyTask (3 seeds), cross-merge (0.508) ≈ KD-through-transducer (0.520) within noise. Vanilla Hinton KD (0.534) is best because the student can re-train its core. Cross-merge's contribution is **methodological, not performance-based**: it isolates protocol channel capacity from student learning capacity by freezing both substrates and supervising with ground-truth labels only. See `scripts/measure_kd_ablation.py`.

### What the paper genuinely claims vs not

Three findings probably novel: (1) the four-point scaling law with plateau at $\sim 2\text{–}3\%$ substrate-intrinsic floor, (2) reproducible $\sim 2\text{–}3\%$ LIF spike-expressivity edge over matched-capacity MLP on XOR-on-noise (15/15 seeds), (3) orthogonality of pool-scale (compresses gap) and architecture-scale (amplifies gap).

The paper explicitly does **not** claim: a new learning algorithm, superiority over knowledge distillation on task accuracy, or universal representations — that debate is addressed by Saxe 2024 and the Nature MI 2025 editorial (s42256-025-01139-y) cited in `docs/positioning.md`.

### Cross-lab methodology commitment

The sister project `bouba_sens` (2026-04-21, `github.com/hypneum-lab/bouba_sens` tag `v0.5.0`) demonstrated that pre-registered findings in this programme must pass three critical tests before publication: **null-model partition controls**, **bootstrap confidence intervals** on sub-threshold effects, and **multi-estimator robustness** checks for MI-based claims. The MI/H = 0.91–0.96 figure above was measured with only one estimator (argmax one-hot + entropy-normalized MI) ; a Sprint-equivalent cross-check against Kraskov kNN and MINE is planned for v1.6 before the paper is submitted. Until then, the MI/H headline is to be read with the usual "single-estimator" caveat that `bouba_sens` paper §6.3 recommends against.

## Post-v1.2.3 API additions (2026-04-21)

Three issues filed by downstream consumers (`bouba_sens`, `dream-of-kiki`)
landed on 2026-04-21 as opt-in knobs — **no change to v1.2.3 headline
numbers**, all new behaviour is off by default.

| Release | Issue | Feature | Motivation (downstream) |
|---------|-------|---------|-------------------------|
| **v1.4.0** | [#4](https://github.com/hypneum-lab/nerve-wml/issues/4) | `GammaThetaMultiplexer` gains `plasticity_schedule` + `constellation_lock_after` | `bouba_sens` B-1 Amedi-2007 gap directionally falsified in 4/5 worlds; biologically-distinct T1/T2 plasticity profiles are the probe. |
| **v1.5.0** | [#5](https://github.com/hypneum-lab/nerve-wml/issues/5) | `Transducer` gains `TransducerGating.GUMBEL_SOFTMAX` (opt-in soft distribution) | `bouba_sens` B-2 Me3-delta under-threshold in 5/5 worlds; hard argmax gating may be too abrupt for post-lesion MI migration. |
| **v1.5.0** | [#7](https://github.com/hypneum-lab/nerve-wml/issues/7) | `MlpWML.from_spectrogram(...)` factory + `SpectrogramEncoder` | DRY: `bouba_sens` MIT-BIH ECG fetcher + future Studyforrest audio share one canonical STFT → carrier path. |
| **v1.5.0** | [#6](https://github.com/hypneum-lab/nerve-wml/issues/6) | `nerve_core.from_dream_of_kiki(...)` scaffold (runtime gated upstream) | Pin the public axiom-bridge contract today so `bouba_sens` can plumb the call site before `dream-of-kiki` publishes its versioned `axioms` API. |
| **v1.5.1** | — | Packaging: `pyproject.toml` `version` sync (stale `1.4.0` on the v1.5.0 commit), `CITATION.cff` keeps concept DOI only. | v1.5.0 shipped with a stale version field — first PyPI release carries the correct metadata. |
