## TL;DR

nerve-wml's core empirical contribution is **a permutation-invariant,
protocol-level measure of inter-substrate code agreement**
(MI / H(codes) + round-trip fidelity + cross-merge ratio) that measures
something CKA does not capture and that knowledge distillation does not
directly test. Three concrete distinctions:

1. **MI/H is permutation-invariant at the code level; CKA is not.**
   On the same trained MLP/LIF pairs, CKA(argmax one-hots) = 0.910
   while MI/H = 0.953. CKA captures geometric alignment with a fixed
   basis; MI captures statistical dependence modulo any bijection of
   the 64-code alphabet — which is what matters when two substrates
   communicate through a shared discrete protocol (any consistent
   re-labelling is semantically equivalent).
2. **Cross-substrate merge is not knowledge distillation.** In KD the
   student is trained end-to-end to match the teacher's soft labels.
   In cross-merge the student's core and emit head are frozen; only a
   linear transducer between the teacher's emitted code space and the
   student's input features is learned. The substrates' inductive
   biases are preserved; we measure whether the discrete-code protocol
   carries enough information to drive a frozen student.
3. **The shared-code plateau is more specific than "universal
   representations".** The literature on representational convergence
   across architectures (Morcos 2018, Kornblith 2019) reports
   geometric alignment for models trained on the same task. Our
   specific finding is that argmax-discretized outputs over a shared
   64-code alphabet share 91–96 % of their information — a stronger
   statement at the output surface, where the protocol actually lives.

## Empirical: CKA vs our MI/H

Script: `scripts/measure_cka_vs_mi.py`. Measured at
HardFlowProxyTask, `d_hidden = n_neurons = 16`, 400 training steps,
batch = 1024, 3 seeds.

| seed | MI / H (ours) | CKA pre-emit | CKA emit logits | CKA argmax one-hot |
|------|---------------|--------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| 0    | 0.949         | 0.785        | 0.692           | 0.932              |
| 1    | 1.000         | 0.777        | 0.608           | 0.981              |
| 2    | 0.910         | 0.677        | 0.572           | 0.818              |
| mean | **0.953**     | 0.747        | 0.624           | 0.910              |

### Reading the numbers

- **CKA pre-emit (0.747)** — the hidden states of MLP and LIF are
  geometrically different (CKA < 1). They don't "think" the same way
  internally, despite training on the same task. This matches the
  general finding that different architectures find different features
  even for the same data.
- **CKA emit logits (0.624)** — the emit heads amplify the geometric
  divergence. The logit vectors are even less aligned than the hidden
  states.
- **CKA argmax one-hot (0.910)** — collapsing to the argmax re-aligns
  the two substrates: they agree on which code fires, even if the raw
  logit geometry differs. This is the regime our MI/H operates in.
- **MI/H (0.953)** — strictly higher than CKA argmax (0.910). MI
  captures statistical dependence under *any* permutation of code
  labels; CKA requires alignment in the original basis. If MLP's code
  23 systematically maps to LIF's code 47 on the same inputs, MI
  records full agreement; CKA of one-hots does not, because the basis
  differs.

### What this means for the paper

Our measurement picks up a dimension of substrate agreement that CKA
misses by construction. The protocol-level question is
*"given the same input, do the two substrates emit codes that carry
the same information?"*, not
*"are the two substrates geometrically similar?"*. MI / H
operationalises the former; CKA operationalises the latter; the two
are related but not equivalent.

The 4.3-percentage-point gap between CKA argmax one-hot (0.910) and
MI/H (0.953) is small but consistent across seeds — the substrates
use slightly permuted code spaces, not identical ones. A learned
transducer (round-trip, cross-merge) would absorb this permutation,
which is why those two metrics are even higher (0.99 and 0.97).

## Conceptual: cross-merge vs knowledge distillation

Knowledge distillation (Hinton, Vinyals, Dean, 2015) sets up:

    Teacher (frozen) → soft labels p_T(y|x)
                             ↓
                    Student (end-to-end trainable)
                             ↓
                    Loss = KL(p_T || p_S)  (+ optional CE on hard labels)

Cross-substrate merge (our Gate M-cross, v0.8) sets up:

    MLP (frozen):  x → core → emit_head_pi(x) → logits_MLP
                                                     ↓
                                     Transducer (only this is trained)
                                                     ↓
                                      feature vector in LIF input space
                                                     ↓
    LIF (frozen):                         emit_head_pi → logits_LIF
                                                     ↓
                                              CE vs hard labels y

Three structural differences from KD:

1. **What is trained.** KD trains the student. Cross-merge trains
   neither substrate — only a linear transducer. Both substrates'
   inductive biases are preserved by construction.
2. **What is passed.** KD passes the teacher's full softmax
   distribution over labels. Cross-merge passes logits over the 64-
   code *protocol alphabet* (typically ≫ n_classes), so the message
   carries more bits than the label entropy. This is the protocol
   channel's capacity.
3. **What is supervised.** KD's loss compares the student's
   distribution to the teacher's. Cross-merge's loss compares the
   student's *final label prediction* to the ground-truth label. The
   teacher provides features through the transducer but never
   supervises the student's output directly.

A reviewer will probably say *"this is just distillation with extra
steps"*. The response is that (a) the empirical question is
different — can a frozen student recover task competence from discrete
protocol-level signals? — and (b) the setup isolates *protocol
transmission* from *model capacity transfer*, which KD does not
separate.

A useful extension would be an ablation: re-run cross-merge with a
non-linear transducer (2-layer MLP) and with soft-label KD on the
same frozen-student setup, and report the three accuracies side-by-
side. That would quantify how much of cross-merge's 97 % ratio is
*protocol expressiveness* vs *linear-readout capacity*.

## Literature scan

### Representational similarity

- **Kornblith et al. 2019, "Similarity of Neural Network
  Representations Revisited"** — introduces linear and RBF CKA.
  Invariant to orthogonal transformation and isotropic scaling.
  Measures: geometric similarity of hidden representations at the
  continuous level. Does not directly measure discrete output
  agreement.
- **Morcos, Raghu, Bengio 2018, "Insights on representational
  similarity via SVCCA / PWCCA"** — canonical correlation variants.
  Same limitation: continuous, basis-sensitive.
- **Raghu et al. 2017, "SVCCA"** — earlier; same family.
- **Li et al. 2015, "Convergent learning"** — observes that different
  networks trained on the same task learn overlapping representations
  at different layers.

Our MI / H is the **discrete, permutation-invariant cousin** of this
family. It is appropriate when the relevant interface is a discrete
alphabet (a protocol), not a continuous embedding.

### Universal / natural representations hypothesis

- **Wentworth, "Natural Abstractions" (alignmentforum, 2021)** —
  non-academic but widely discussed: posits that different cognitive
  systems trained on similar environments converge on similar
  abstractions. Our 0.91–0.96 MI/H is consistent with this if read
  as empirical evidence, though the task distribution is
  synthetic/MNIST-only.
- **Moschella et al. 2022, "Relative representations enable zero-shot
  latent space communication"** — shows that similarity-based
  relative encodings generalize across independently trained models.
  Closer to our claim in spirit; uses continuous relative encodings,
  we use discrete codebook.
- **Koch et al. 2024, "On Emergent Similarity"** — review of when
  convergent representations emerge.

### Cross-substrate (ANN/SNN hybrid) communication

- **Neftci, Mostafa, Zenke 2019, "Surrogate gradient learning"** —
  trains SNNs with differentiable proxies (we use this). Does not
  address cross-substrate communication.
- **Rueckauer et al. 2017, "Conversion of continuous-valued deep
  networks to efficient event-driven networks"** — ANN→SNN conversion
  via weight mapping. Different goal: deployment, not communication.
- **Pfeiffer & Pfeil 2018, "Deep learning with spiking neurons"** —
  survey; confirms that ANN↔SNN information exchange via discrete
  codes is underexplored.

Our specific setup — *independent training of MLP and LIF, then
measure agreement of their emitted codes via a shared alphabet* — is
not the standard ANN/SNN hybrid workflow (which usually converts one
to the other). This is a contribution if described that way.

### Multi-agent and modular communication

- **Foerster et al. 2016, "Learning to communicate with deep
  multi-agent reinforcement learning"** — agents learn discrete
  messages. Closest relative of our protocol, but RL-trained rather
  than task-supervised on a shared alphabet.
- **Shazeer et al. 2017, "Outrageously large neural networks:
  the sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts layer"** — introduces
  MoE routing. Different purpose: capacity, not cross-substrate
  agreement.
- **Fedus et al. 2021, "Switch Transformer"** — scales MoE; same
  purpose.
- **Sukhbaatar et al. 2016, "Learning multiagent communication with
  backpropagation"** — agents exchange continuous vectors. Precursor
  to Foerster 2016.

### Knowledge distillation

- **Hinton, Vinyals, Dean 2015, "Distilling the knowledge in a
  neural network"** — original KD, soft-label teacher → student.
- **Romero et al. 2015, "FitNets"** — hint-based distillation of
  intermediate features.
- **Tian et al. 2020, "Contrastive representation distillation"** —
  representation-level distillation.

Our cross-merge is distinct in freezing both ends and training only a
transducer in between, and in measuring through a discrete protocol
alphabet. Closest in spirit: Tian's contrastive approach, but that
still trains the student.

## Where this leaves the novelty claim

### What is probably new (in the specific sense)

1. **The MI / H measurement applied to discrete protocol-level emitted
   codes, paired with round-trip fidelity and cross-substrate merge
   measured via frozen-end transducer.** No single prior paper
   (to our knowledge) combines these three metrics on substrates of
   structurally different families (MLP / LIF / Transformer).
2. **The scaling law with plateau** (N ∈ {2, 16, 32, 64}, median gap
   10.7 % → 6.7 % → 2.4 % → 2.7 %) for a specific substrate-
   agnostic protocol. Scaling laws on representational similarity
   exist, but not in this exact "pool-size vs substrate gap"
   formulation.
3. **The observation that code alignment is structural** — MI at
   filler timesteps ≈ MI at trained timesteps in the temporal
   experiment. Suggests substrates align before task pressure; this
   is consistent with universal-representations but empirically
   specific to our setup.

### What is not new

- The substrates (MLP, LIF, Transformer — all standard).
- The task bench (HardFlowProxyTask is synthetic; MoonsTask and MNIST
  are standard).
- The tools (CKA, KD, MI estimators, codebook, transducers).
- The idea of substrate-agnostic communication (present in the
  modular-agents / MoE literature).

## Next steps for a stronger paper

1. **Run CKA + MI/H + KD at matched compute** on a single trained
   pair, reporting all three numbers in the same table. This is a
   one-page table that would settle the reviewer's question cleanly.
2. **Test non-linear transducer in cross-merge** to separate protocol
   expressiveness from transducer capacity.
3. **Add a real-data cross-merge** (MNIST teacher → MNIST frozen LIF)
   as a stress test. Hypothesis: retains > 85 % given MNIST structure.
4. **Cite Moschella 2022 explicitly** — their "relative
   representations" result is the closest spiritual neighbour and
   would strengthen §Related Work.
