# Changelog

All notable changes to `nerve-wml` follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-20

Closes the three remaining scientific debts identified in the v1.1.1 audit: real-data validation (MNIST), bigger-architecture sensitivity (d_hidden=128), and temporal streaming (sequential tokens). Three new figures published.

### Added

- `track_w/tasks/mnist.py` — MNISTTask seed-stable flattened loader (torchvision, optional `mnist` extra).
- `track_w/tasks/sequential.py` — SequentialFlowProxyTask (16-token sequence, label at a supervised timestep).
- `track_w/configs/wml_config.py` — WmlConfig with `.mnist()` and `.large()` presets.
- `track_w/streaming_hooks.py` — per-timestep rollout helpers.
- `input_dim` parameter on MlpWML / LifWML / TransformerWML (backward compatible).
- `track_w.pool_factory.build_pool_cfg(cfg)` — config-driven pool.
- `scripts/run_mnist_pilots.py`, `run_bigger_arch.py`, `run_temporal_pilots.py` + three figure renderers.

### Scientific findings (v1.2)

- **MNIST (real data):** MLP 0.942, LIF 0.941, median gap **1.03 %**, `MI/H = 0.882` over 3 seeds.
- **Bigger arch (d_hidden=128):** substrate asymmetry AMPLIFIES (median gap **26 %**) — spike expressivity scales with `n_neurons`. Architecture scale and pool scale are orthogonal dimensions. Claim B survives: `MI/H > 0.50` even when accuracies diverge.
- **Temporal streaming:** `MI/H = 0.72` at trained step, `0.71` at filler step — alignment is structural, not task-pressure-gated.

### Paper

- §Information Transmission extended with subsections (4a) MNIST, (4b) architecture scale, (4c) temporal streaming, each with figure.
- Three figures: `mnist_scaling.pdf`, `bigger_arch_scaling.pdf`, `temporal_info_tx.pdf`.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-20

A single intensive session upgraded four scientific claims from architectural postulates to empirical measurements. Paper drafts v0.4 through v0.8 track the iterations.

### Added

- **LifWML.emit\_head\_pi** — learned `nn.Linear(n_neurons, alphabet_size)` symmetric to `MlpWML.emit_head_pi`. The protocol `step()` preserves the cosine-similarity pattern-match decoder (N-1 invariant); classification pilots read out the learned head for apples-to-apples comparison. Resolved §13.1 debt #1.
- **TransformerWML** (`track_w/transformer_wml.py`) — third substrate: tokenized input + `nn.TransformerEncoder(n_layers × n_heads)` + `emit_head_pi` / `emit_head_eps`. Obeys WML Protocol and invariants W-1, W-2, W-5. 7 unit tests pin the Protocol compliance surface.
- **W2-hard scaling pilots** — `run_w2_hard_n16`, `run_w2_hard_n32`, `run_w2_hard_n64` plus their multi-seed wrappers (`_multiseed`). RNG-isolated per cohort (MLP / LIF / task-eval) using explicit seed parameter.
- **Triple-substrate polymorphism pilot** — `run_w_triple_substrate(hard=False|True)`. Trains MLP + LIF + TRF on the same task with RNG isolation; reports `triple_gap = (max − min) / max`.
- **Inter-substrate information-transmission pilots** — `scripts/measure_info_transmission.py`: mutual-information between emitted codes, round-trip fidelity MLP→LIF→MLP through learned transducers, and cross-substrate merge where a frozen LIF recovers task accuracy from MLP-emitted codes only.
- **Four-point scaling-law figure** — `scripts/render_scaling_figure.py` produces `papers/paper1/figures/w2_hard_scaling.{pdf,png}` with median ± IQR error bars and a 5 % contract band.

### Scientific findings (honest)

- **Polymorphism scaling law (4 points, 5 seeds each except N=2)** — median gap:
  - $N=2 \to 10.71\%$
  - $N=16 \to 6.71\%$ (max $10.35\%$)
  - $N=32 \to 2.39\%$ (max $4.75\%$ — every seed satisfies the 5 % contract)
  - $N=64 \to 2.73\%$ (plateau; max $3.71\%$)
  Monotonic decay between $N=2$ and $N=32$, plateau at $\sim 2\text{--}3\%$ for $N \geq 32$. Direction stable: LIF $\geq$ MLP in **15/15 multi-seed measurements**.
- **Information transmission measured** — on HardFlowProxyTask, for independently trained MLP and LIF on the same input: $\mathrm{MI}(c_{\text{MLP}}, c_{\text{LIF}}) / H(c_{\text{MLP}}) \approx 0.91$ (substrates share $\sim 91\%$ of their code information), round-trip fidelity $\approx 0.99$, cross-merge ratio $\approx 0.97$. Claim B (substrate-agnostic information transmission) is empirical, not just architectural.
- **Triple-substrate saturation** — on FlowProxyTask, MLP / LIF / TRF all converge to $1.000$ (triple-gap $0\%$). On HardFlowProxyTask at $N=1$: $0.547 / 0.605 / 0.529$ (triple-gap $12.6\%$). Pool scaling not yet measured for TRF.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-19

First stable release. All eleven gates pass on commodity Apple Silicon; the paper v0.3 draft consolidates every gate's measurements.

### Added

- **Gate P** — Track-P protocol simulator (`track_p/sim_nerve.py`, `track_p/vq_codebook.py`, `track_p/transducer.py`, `track_p/router.py`). Pilots P1–P4 pass on toy signals.
- **Gate W** — Track-W WML lab (`track_w/mock_nerve.py`, `track_w/mlp_wml.py`, `track_w/lif_wml.py`). MLP ↔ LIF polymorphism gap 0 % on FlowProxyTask 4-class.
- **Gate M** — merge pipeline (`bridge/sim_nerve_adapter.py`, `bridge/merge_trainer.py`) retaining 100 % of mock baseline.
- **Gate M2** — four §13.1 scientific shortcuts resolved: P3 γ-priority ablation (26 % collision without rule), W2 true-LIF polymorphie on HardFlowProxyTask (12.1 % gap — honest), W4 rehearsal CL (forgetting 100 % → 0 %), P1 random-init VQ + codebook rotation (dead codes 39 % → 0 %).
- **Paper v0.2** — ablation table, figures 2–4 (W4 forgetting, P1 dead-code curves, W2 histogram), §Threats, §Reproducibility.
- **Gate Scale** — W1/W2/W4 pilots at N=16 plus W2 stress at N=32; router strongly connected for all N ∈ {4, 8, 16, 32}.
- **Gate Interp** — `interpret/` package: semantics extractor (`build_semantics_table`), torch k-means (`cluster_codes_by_activation`), plain-HTML report renderer (`render_html_report`). Cluster entropy > 2 bits on toy data.
- **Gate Neuro** — `neuromorphic/` package: INT8 symmetric quantization (`quantize_lif_wml`), pure-numpy mock runner (`MockNeuromorphicRunner`), software-vs-mock delta check, Loihi 2 / Akida stubs with informative `NotImplementedError`.
- **Gate Dream** (partial) — `bridge/dream_bridge.py` ε-trace collect/encode/apply pipeline, env-gated by `DREAM_CONSOLIDATION_ENABLED`, with `MockConsolidator` for CI. Full resolution awaits `kiki_oniric` v0.5+ public `consolidate()` surface.
- **Gate Adaptive** — `track_p/adaptive_codebook.py` with `active_mask`-based shrink/grow, `bridge/transducer_resize.py` reshaping transducers while preserving argmax on kept rows. Multi-cycle stability tested.
- **Gate LLM Advisor** — `bridge/kiki_nerve_advisor.py` with env-gated, never-raising `advise(query_tokens, current_route) -> dict | None`. Warm-path latency < 50 ms; disabled-path overhead < 5 ms. Self-contained wiring recipe at `docs/integration/micro-kiki-wiring.md`.
- **Paper v0.3** — abstract names all 11 gates; new `§Integrations` section covering Adaptive / Neuromorphic / Dream / LLM Advisor.
- **Harness** — `harness/run_registry.py` produces bit-stable `run_id` from `(c_version, topology, seed, commit_sha)`.
- **227 tests passing**, coverage ≥ 95 % on every package, `ruff` + `mypy` clean on 49 source files.

### Scientific findings (honest)

- **FlowProxyTask 4-class saturates** both MLP and LIF substrates at 1.000 — the 0 % polymorphie gap is a degenerate best case. Documented in paper §Threats.
- **HardFlowProxyTask (12-class XOR on noise)** exposes real variance: `acc_mlp = 0.547`, `acc_lif = 0.480`, **gap = 12.1 %** — violates < 5 % on non-linear tasks. LIF's cosine-similarity decoder lags the MLP π head. Paper claim is now narrowed to linearly-separable regimes; closing the gap on harder tasks is explicit future work.
- **Untrained-LIF INT8 mock-runner delta ≈ 19 %** on random inputs — INT8 quantization of binary-like codebooks is coarse. Trained LIFs are expected to tighten.

### Infrastructure

- Eleven gate tags on origin, all `git push`-able and linked from README: `gate-p-passed`, `gate-w-passed`, `gate-m-passed`, `gate-m2-passed`, `gate-scale-passed`, `gate-interp-passed`, `gate-neuro-passed`, `gate-dream-passed`, `gate-adaptive-passed`, `gate-llm-advisor-passed`, plus `paper-v0.2-draft` and `paper-v0.3-draft`.
- No vendor SDK runtime deps: Loihi, Akida, `dream-of-kiki`, `sentence-transformers` are all opt-in.
- `MIT` for code, `CC-BY-4.0` for docs.
