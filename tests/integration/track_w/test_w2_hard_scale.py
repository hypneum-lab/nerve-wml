"""W2-hard at scale: does the polymorphism gap contract hold?

Background: at N=2 with the v0.4 symmetric heads, run_w2_hard reports
a 10.7 % gap in the LIF > MLP direction — large enough to violate the
5 % polymorphism contract. The question this test answers is whether
that gap reflects a real substrate asymmetry or seed-level variance.

Empirical finding (2026-04-20, refined with multi-seed v0.5):
  - Single-seed (seed=0): N=16 gap ≈ 1.68 %, N=32 gap ≈ 1.55 %.
  - Multi-seed (seeds 0..4, N=16): mean_gap ≈ 6.29 %, median ≈ 6.71 %,
    p25 ≈ 4.67 %, p75 ≈ 8.02 %, max ≈ 10.35 %. LIF > MLP in 5/5 seeds.

Honest narrative: the gap DIRECTION is substrate-reproducible (LIF
edges MLP on non-linear tasks thanks to spike expressivity), but the
magnitude is distributionally ~6–7 % — above the 5 % contract. The
contract is appropriate for saturated / linearly-separable regimes;
on hard tasks, a ~7 % gap with stable direction is the honest
measurement.
